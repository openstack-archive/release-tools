==========================================================================
openstack-releasing - A set of scripts to handle OpenStack release process
==========================================================================

How to Release
==============

Deliverables should all be using post-versioning, getting their version
information from git tags and not having any version specifier in the
``setup.cfg``.

Release requests are filed as patches to deliverables files in
the ``openstack/releases`` repository, see the README there for more
details.

Before beginning this process, you need to set up ``gpg`` with a valid
key, and authorize launchpad to run the release tools
commands. Authorizing launchpad can be tricky on a system that only
provides a terminal-based browser, since the launchpad site does not
work well with the default configuration of ``lynx`` (cookies and
referrer headers need to be enabled for the launchpad site). Newer
versions of launchpadlib also rely on keyring, which may require a
password for every command being run if you are not in a graphical
environment with a better interactive key manager. Talk with dhellmann
if you start a release and run into trouble with launchpad auth.

When a release request is ready to be approved, follow these steps:

1. The release team member taking responsibility for the
   release should approve the change in ``openstack/releases``.
   Release requests should not be approved until we are actually ready
   to cut the release.

2. After the release request merges, check out or update a local copy
   of ``openstack/releases`` to get the new version of the file under
   the ``deliverables`` directory. Make sure you check out the
   releases repository to the commit with the new release request you
   want to process, in case multiple requests merge around the same
   time. The release tools only look at the most recent commit to
   detect which deliverable files have changed.

3. In a local copy of this
   ``openstack-infra/release-tools`` repository, run
   ``release_from_yaml.sh``, giving the path to the
   ``openstack/releases`` repository.

   For example::

      $ ./release_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases

4. As the release script runs, it will prompt you for your GPG key
   passphrase before adding the tag. This gives you a last chance to
   review the proposed tag before proceeding. After the tag is created
   locally and pushed up to the remote server, the script will push
   comments to closed Launchpad bugs since the previous tag.

5. Announce the release.

   1. Milestones are manually announced once all projects are done
      (usually at the closing of the milestone window), using an email
      recapitulating all projects that did a milestone tag and
      pointing to milestone tarballs. The process to follow for
      announcements of releases will be added here soon.

   2. Library and tool releases are announced via one of the OpenStack
      mailing lists. See the instructions for running announce.sh
      below.


Prerequisites
=============

The prerequisites for all of the scripts are defined in
``requirements.txt``.

Each shell script should try to create a Python virtualenv to install
the packages before running any of the commands written in Python. If
you start seeing import errors after updating your sandbox, it is
likely that a new dependency was added. Try removing ``.tox/venv`` and
running the command again.

Top-level scripts
=================

The top-level scripts call the various base tools to get their work done.


release_from_yaml.sh
--------------------

This script takes YAML files describing deliverables to release (like those
living in ``openstack/releases``) and calls the release.sh script (see below)
to apply the corresponding tags. It will create a tag for the last release
mentioned in the file(s). You can point it to specific YAML files, or to a
local git repository (in which case it will look at the files modified in the
most recent commit).

Examples:

::

  ./release_from_yaml.sh ../openstack-releases deliverables/mitaka/nova.yaml

Call release.sh for all repositories mentioned in the last release added
to ../openstack-releases/deliverables/mitaka/nova.yaml

::

  ./release_from_yaml.sh ../openstack-releases

Look into the git repository at ../openstack-releases for deliverable YAML
files modified at the last commit, and call release.sh for all repositories
mentioned on the last release in each such file.


release.sh
----------

This script creates a tag on a given repository SHA and pushes it to Gerrit.
Additionally it will add a message on Launchpad bugs that are mentioned as
"closed" in git commit messages since the last tag on the same series.

Example:

::

  ./release.sh openstack/oslo.rootwrap mitaka 3.0.3 gerrit/master

Apply a 3.0.3 tag (associated to the mitaka series) to the gerrit master
HEAD of the openstack/oslo.rootwrap reporitory, and add a comment for each
closed bug mentioned in commit messages since the previous mitaka tag (3.0.2).

announce.sh
-----------

This script generates an email message ready to be sent to announce
the release of a library or other tool. Note that the EMAIL environment
variable needs to be set prior to running the tool.

Example:

::

  ./announce.sh ~/repos/openstack/oslo.rootwrap
  ./announce.sh ~/repos/openstack/oslo.rootwrap 3.0.3

The output goes to ``relnotes/`` in a file named for the project and
version. For example, the announcement for the rootwrap release above
would be written to ``relnotes/oslo.rootwrap-3.0.3``.

rccut.sh
--------

Final release for pre-versioned components follows a slightly different
process. Just before RC1 we need to create a stable/* release branch.
rccut.sh creates a stable/$SERIES branch from the specified SHA, and turns
all Launchpad bugs for the RC1 milestone to FixReleased (which means
"present in the release branch").

It supports deliverables with multiple repositories, using an additional
parameter to point to the main deliverable (in which case it skips Launchpad
update). It special-cases oslo-incubator, where it doesn't wait for a tarball
to be built.

Examples:

::

  ./rccut.sh 7432f32d838ab346c liberty nova

Create a series/liberty branch for Nova at commit 7432f32d838ab346c, and
mark FixCommitted bugs FixReleased, while targeting them to the juno-rc1
milestone.

::

  ./rccut.sh 3472368b3a546d liberty neutron-fwaas neutron

Create a series/liberty branch for neutron-fwaas at commit 3472368b3a546d.


rcdelivery.sh
-------------

This script is used for pre-versioned projects to publish RCs and final
release from the stable/$SERIES branch. It applies the RC or final tag,
pushes it, waits for the tarball build, and uploads the resulting
tarball to Launchpad (while marking it released).

It supports deliverables with multiple repositories, using an additional
parameter to point to the main deliverable (in which case it uploads to the
main Launchpad page). It special-cases oslo-incubator, where no tarball is
generated or needs to be uploaded.

Examples:

::

  ./rcdelivery.sh kilo rc1 cinder

Push 2015.1.0rc1 tag to current cinder stable/kilo branch HEAD, wait for
the tarball build, and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while
marking it released).

::

  ./rcdelivery kilo final neutron-fwaas neutron

Push 2015.1.0 final tag to current neutron-fwaas stable/kilo branch HEAD
(which should be the last RC), wait for the tarball build, and upload the
resulting tarball to the "neutron" Launchpad page.


release-notes
-------------

This produces a set of release notes intended to be sent as an
announcement email when a new library or package is produced. It is
more suitable for libraries than for the major projects, because it
includes a list of all of the changes and diff-stats output to show
which files changed.

The script parses the README.rst to find a line matching "``Bugs:``",
extracts the URL following the colon, and includes that information in
the output.

The bugs URL is converted to a launchpad project URL and combined with
the final version number to produce a *milestone* URL.

The script uses ``python setup.py`` to determine the project name and
the one-line description to include in the output text.

Examples:

::

  release-notes ~/repos/openstack/oslo.config 1.7.0 1.8.0

Print the release notes between versions 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 for the
project in the ``~/repos/openstack/oslo.config`` directory.

::

  release-notes --show-dates --changes-only ~/repos/openstack/oslo.config 1.8.0 HEAD

Print the list of changes after 1.8.0 for the project in the
``~/repos/openstack/oslo.config`` directory, including the date of
the change but leaving out the email message boilerplate. This mode
is useful for examining the list of unreleased changes in a project
to decide if a release is warranted and to pick a version number.


list_unreleased_changes.sh
--------------------------

Given a branch and one or more repositories, produce a list of the
changes in those repositories since their last tag on that
branch. This is useful for deciding if a project needs to prepare a
release, and for predicting what the next release version should be by
looking at the commit logs.

::

  ./list_unreleased_changes.sh master openstack/oslo.config

Print the list of changes in ``openstack/oslo.config`` along the
master branch.

::

  ./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo $(list-repos --code-only --team Oslo)

Print the list of changes in the ``stable/kilo`` branch of all Oslo
libraries.


list_oslo_unreleased_changes.sh
-------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh for all of the Oslo library
repositories.

::

  ./list_oslo_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo

is equivalent to:

::

  ./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo $(list-repos --code-only --team Oslo)


list_library_unreleased_changes.sh
----------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh for all libraries managed by any
project.


list_stable_unreleased_changes.sh
---------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh with the given branch for all
repositories tagged with ``stable:follows-policy``.


::

  ./list_stable_unreleased_changes.sh stable/liberty


is equivalent to:

::

  ./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/liberty $(list-repos --tag stable:follows-policy)

make_stable_branch.sh
---------------------

This script makes a stable branch from an existing tag and updates the
.gitreview file in the new branch for future submissions.

::

  ./make_stable_branch.sh kilo openstack/oslo.config 1.9.2

batch-stable-branches
---------------------

This command generates a series of calls to make_stable_branch.sh
using the governance repository and releases repository as inputs.

::

  batch-stable-branches --tag type:library --tag release:has-stable-branches --tag release:managed -r ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka

branch_from_yaml.sh
-------------------

This script looks at the deliverable files to decide how to create
stable branches.

::

  $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka
  $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka
  $ branch_from_yaml.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka deliverables/_independent/openstack-ansible.yaml

make_feature_branch.sh
----------------------

Feature branches need to have "feature/" at the beginning of the name
and should have their ``.gitreview`` updated when the branch is
created.

::

  ./make_feature_branch.sh keystoneauth_integration python-keystoneclient 4776495adfadbf5240a9e0f169990ce139af9549

list-repos
----------

Read the project list from the governance repository and print a list
of the repositories, filtered by team and/or tag.

::

  list-repos --team oslo
  list-repos --tag release:managed --tag type:library

latest-deliverable-versions
---------------------------

Show each repository and the latest tag recorded in the deliverable
file associated with that repo.

::

  latest-deliverable-versions -r ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka

update_git_review.sh
--------------------

Update the .gitreview file in a specific branch of a checked out
repositories.

::

  ./update_git_review.sh stable/kilo ~/repos/openstack/oslo.*


launchpad-login
---------------

Test or configure the launchpad credentials. This will set up a
keyring entry for the launchpad site, prompt for credentials, and
handle the OAuth handshake. All of the other launchpad-connected
commands will do these steps, too, but this command takes no other
action after logging in so it is safe to run it repeatedly.


check_library_constraints.sh
----------------------------

Script to check the current list of constraints against the most
recent release for all of the library projects. This script can be
used at any point, but is especially intended to ensure that the
constraints for things we release are all updated at the end of a
release cycle. To run the script, check out both the release-tools and
requirements repositories and then run the script as::

  $ check_library_constraints.sh /path/to/requirements-repository stable/mitaka

propose-final-releases
----------------------

Command to edit the deliverable files in a releases repository to
propose final releases. The command modifies files in an existing copy
of the repository and does not invoke git at all, so you need to
create a branch before running it then review the output, commit the
changes, and push the patch to gerrit.

::

  $ propose-final-releases -r ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka

Base tools
==========

milestone-close
---------------

Marks a Launchpad milestone as released and sets it inactive so no
more bugs or blueprints can be targeted to it.

Example::

  milestone-close oslotest 1.8.0


milestone-rename
----------------

Renames a Launchpad milestone.

Example:

::

  milestone-rename oslo.rootwrap next-juno 1.3.0

Rename oslo.rootwrap next-juno milestone to 1.3.0.


ms2version.py
-------------

Converts milestone code names (juno-1) to version numbers suitable for tags
(2014.2.b1). If used with --onlycheck, only checks that the milestone
exists in Launchpad (useful for Swift where the rules are different).

Examples:

::

  ./ms2version.py nova kilo-3

Returns 2015.1.0b3 (after checking that the kilo-3 milestone exists in Nova)

::

  ./ms2version.py swift 2.1.0 --onlycheck

Exists successfully if there is a 2.1.0 milestone in Swift.


repo_tarball_diff.sh
--------------------

This script fetches a specific branch from a git repository into a temp
directory and compares its content with the content of a tarball produced
from it (using "python setup.py sdist"). The difference should only contain
additional generated files (Changelog, AUTHORS...) and missing ignored
files (.gitignore...).

Example:

::

  ./repo_tarball_diff.sh nova master

Check the difference between Nova master branch contant and a tarball
that would be generated from it.

compare_tarball_diff.sh
-----------------------

Download published tarballs and compare them against what is produced
by running the sdist command locally. This can be used to verify that
a tarball published for download was built correctly and has not been
modified.

Example:

::

  ./compare_tarball_diff.sh openstack/nova 13.0.0

validate_tarballs.sh
--------------------

Given a release series, download and validate all of the tarballs to
ensure that they match what was tagged.

Example:

::

  ./validate_tarballs.sh ~/repos/openstack/releases mitaka

pre_expire.py
-------------

This script fetches opened bugs for a project in order to prepare bugs with no
activity in the last D days for expiration by:
- unsetting bug assignee
- unsetting bug milestone
- setting bug status to Incomplete
- adding a comment explaining why we updated the bug

Examples:

::

  ./pre_expire_bugs.py neutron --days 180

Prepare for expiration neutron bugs with no activity not updated in the last
180 days.

::

  ./pre_expire_bugs.py glance --days 365 --test

Test prepare for expiration on Launchpad Staging servers.

::

  ./pre_expire_bugs.py glance --days 365 --dry-run

Prepare for expiration dry-run: print actions without executing them.


process_bugs.py
---------------

This script fetches bugs for a project (by default all "FixCommitted" bugs,
or all open bugs targeted to a given milestone if you pass the --milestone
argument) and sets a milestone target for them (--settarget) and/or sets their
status to "Fix Released" (--fixrelease).

It ignores bugs that have already a milestone set, if that milestone does
not match the one in --settarget.

Examples:

::

  ./process_bugs.py nova --settarget=grizzly-3 --fixrelease

Sets the target for all Nova FixCommitted bugs to grizzly-3 and mark
them 'Fix Released'.

::

  ./process_bugs.py glance --settarget=grizzly-2 --status='Fix Released' --test

Test setting the target for all untargeted Glance FixReleased bugs to
grizzly-2 on Launchpad Staging servers.

::

  ./process_bugs.py neutron --milestone juno-3 --settarget juno-rc1

Move all juno-3 open bugs from juno-3 to juno-rc1 milestone.


wait_for_tarball.py
-------------------

This script queries Jenkins tarball-building jobs to find either a job
matching the provided --mpsha SHA building milestone-proposed.tar.gz,
or a job matching the provided --tag. It then waits for that job completion
and reports the built tarball name.

Examples:

::

  ./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --mpsha=59089e56f674f5f94f67c5986e9a616bb669d846

Looks for a cinder-branch-tarball job matching SHA 59089e... which would
produce a milestone-proposed.tar.gz tarball, and waits for completion

::

  ./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --tag=2013.1.1

Looks for a cinder-tarball job for tag "2013.1.1" and waits for completion.


upload_release.py
-----------------

This script grabs a tarball from tarballs.openstack.org and uploads it
to Launchpad, marking the milestone released and inactive in the process.
If used with the --nop argument, it will only mark the milestone released and
inactive (this is used for projects like oslo-incubator which do not release
source code).

The script prompts you to confirm that the tarball looks like the one you
intend to release, and to sign the tarball upload.

Examples:

::

  ./upload_release.py nova 2015.1.0 --milestone=kilo-3

Uploads Nova's nova-2015.1.0b3.tar.gz to the kilo-3 milestone page.

::

  ./upload_release.py glance 2015.1.0 --test

Uploads Glance's glance-2015.1.0.tar.gz to the final "2015.1.0" milestone
as glance-2015.1.0.tar.gz, on Launchpad staging server

::

  ./upload_release.py cinder 2012.2.3 --tarball=stable-folsom

Uploads Cinder's current cinder-stable-folsom.tar.gz to the 2012.2.3
milestone as cinder-2012.2.3.tar.gz


consolidate_release_page.py
---------------------------

This script moves blueprints and bugs from interim milestones to the final
release milestone page, in order to show all bugs and features fixed during
the cycle. For Swift, this will only move X-rc* bugs and blueprints to
final X release.

The --copytask mode is an experimental variant where a series bugtask is
created and the release milestone is set on that bugtask, preserving the
information from the "development" bugtask (and the milestone the bug was
fixed in).

Examples:

::

  ./consolidate_release_page.py cinder kilo 2015.1.0

Moves Cinder blueprints and bugs from intermediary kilo milestones
to the final 2015.1 milestone page.

::

  ./consolidate_release_page.py --test swift grizzly 1.8.0

Moves Swift 1.8.0-rc* blueprints and bugs to the final 1.8.0 page, on
Launchpad staging server

::

  ./consolidate_release_page.py --copytask glance kilo 2015.1.0

Moves Glance blueprints from intermediary kilo milestones to the final
2015.1.0 milestone page. Creates kilo series task for all grizzly bugs
and sets the milestone for those to 2015.1.0.


milestones-create
-----------------

This script lets you create milestones in Launchpad in bulk. It is given a
YAML description of the milestone dates and the projects to add milestones
to. The script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times. See
create_milestones.sample.yaml for an example configuration file.

Example::

  milestones-create havana.yaml


milestone-ensure
----------------

This script lets you create one series and milestone in Launchpad. The
script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times.

Example::

  milestone-ensure oslo.config liberty next-liberty


spec2bp.py
----------

This experimental script facilitates setting blueprint fields for approved
specs. It takes the project and blueprint name as arguments. For specs that
are still under review (--in-review) it will set them to "Blocked" (and
definition status to Review). For approved specs it will set definition
status to Approved, and set Spec URL. In both cases it will set the target
milestone, approver name and specified priority (by default, 'Low').

Examples:

::

  ./spec2bp.py glance super-spec --milestone=juno-2 --priority=Medium

Glance's super-spec.rst was approved and you want to add it to juno-2,
with Medium priority. This will do it all for you.

::

  ./spec2bp.py nova --specpath=specs/kilo/approved/my-awesome-spec.rst
    --in-review --milestone=juno-2

Nova's my-awesome-spec.rst is still under review, but you would like to
add the my-awesome-spec blueprint to juno-2 (marked Blocked). Since it's
located in a non-standard path, we specify it using --specpath parameter.

::

  ./spec2bp.py nova my-awesome-spec --priority=High

my-awesome-spec is now approved. You want to flip all the approval bits,
but also change its priority to High. There is no need to pass --specpath
again, spec2bp will infer it from the blueprint URL field.


stable_freeze.py
----------------

A script that can be used to quickly "freeze" all open reviews to a stable
branch.  It may also be used to "thaw" frozen reviews upon re-opening of
the branch for merges.  Reviews are frozen by adding a -2 and thawed by
reverting that and adding a 0.

Examples:

To view open reviews for stable/icehouse 2014.1.4:

::

  ./stable_freeze.py -r 2014.1.4 query

View open reviews for stable/icehouse 2014.1.4.

::

  ./stable_freeze.py -r 2014.1.4 -o ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt

Freeze all open reviews proposed to stable/icehouse. 2014.1.4-freeze.txt will
contain all frozen reviews and this can be used to thaw later on.

::

  ./stable_freeze -r 2014.1.4 -i ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt thaw

Thaw all reviews previously frozen and stored in 2014.1.4-freeze.txt.

::

  ./stable_freeze -r 2014.1.4 -i ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt \
    -c 123777 -c 123778 freeze

Freeze individual changes that have been proposed after the stable freeze
period started.  References to these reviews will be appended to
2014.1.4-freeze.txt to be unfrozen later on.


autokick.py
-----------

A script to periodically clean up blueprints (adjusting series goal based on
target milestone, and optionally kicking unpriotized blueprints from the
milestone. ttx is running it in a cron so you don't have to.

Examples:

To clean up Nova kilo blueprints::

  ./autokick.py nova kilo


highest_semver.py
-----------------

Reads a list of version tags from standard input and prints the
"highest" value as output, ignoring tags that don't look like valid
versions.


translation-cleanup.sh
----------------------

A script to cleanup translations for a release. It updates all
translation source files, downloads translation files and removes
translation files that are not sufficiently translated. It results in
a change that then needs to get reviewed and send to gerrits.

Examples:

To generate a cleanup patch for nova::

  ./translation-cleanup.sh kilo nova


adjust_blueprints.py
--------------------

Run around milestone release time, this script retrieves and parses the list
of blueprints for a given project and:

* sets the milestone target and series goal on recently-implemented blueprints

* removes the milestone target on incomplete milestone-targeted blueprints

Examples:

::

  ./adjust_blueprints.py nova liberty-1

Displays proposed adjustments around Nova liberty-1 blueprints.

::

  ./adjust_blueprints.py nova liberty-1 --target --clean

Targets missing implemented blueprints and cleans incomplete ones for Nova
in liberty-1.


add-comment
-----------

Add a comment to a set of Launchpad bugs. This command requires basic
Launchpad credentials (see launchpad-login).

Example::

  add-comment --subject='Winner' --content='You won!' 1000000 2000000

Add a 'You won!' comment (with subject line 'Winner') to Launchpad
bugs #1000000 and #2000000


update_reviews
--------------

Lift your -2 reviews from a project. Use this after the stable branch has been
created and the project is ready for accept new features.

This tool uses the Gerrit REST API. So you need to provide your username and
password somehow. You probably already have a .gertty.yaml, if not make one.

Example::

  update_reviews oslo.config

The tool looks for all of the changes in the project that you have a -2 vote on
and changes your vote to 0, with the message "This project is now open for new
features."


bugs-fixed-since.py
-------------------

List bugs mentioned in master commit messages starting from a specified commit.

Example::

  ./bugs-fixed-since.py -r ../neutron --start=8.0.0
