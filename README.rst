openstack-releasing - A set of scripts to handle OpenStack release process
==========================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need the following Python modules installed:
 - launchpadlib

similar_tarballs.sh also requires that you have tardiff installed.  If it's not
packaged for your distribution, you can find it at
http://tardiff.coolprojects.org/.


repo_tarball_diff.sh
--------------------

This script fetches a specific branch from a git repository into a temp
directory and compares its content with the content of a tarball produced
from it (using "python setup.py sdist"). The difference should only contain
additional generated files (Changelog, AUTHORS...) and missing ignored
files (.gitignore...).

Example:

./repo_tarball_diff.sh nova master

  Check the difference between Nova master branch contant and a tarball
  that would be generated from it.


similar_tarballs.sh
-------------------

This script compares the content of two tarballs on tarballs.openstack.org.

Example:

./similar_tarballs.sh nova milestone-proposed 2013.1.rc1

  Check content differences between nova-milestone-proposed.tar.gz and
  nova-2013.1.rc1.tar.gz, as found on http://tarballs.openstack.org.


process_bugs.py
---------------

This script fetches bugs for a project (by default all "FixCommitted" bugs)
and sets a milestone target for them (--settarget) and/or sets their status
to "Fix Released" (--fixrelease).

It ignores bugs that have already a milestone set, if that milestone does
not match the one in --settarget.

Examples:

./process_bugs.py nova --settarget=grizzly-3 --fixrelease

  Sets the target for all Nova FixCommitted bugs to grizzly-3 
  and mark them 'Fix Released'.

./process_bugs.py glance --settarget=grizzly-2 --status='Fix Released' --test

  Test setting the target for all untargeted Glance FixReleased bugs to
  grizzly-2 on Launchpad Staging servers.


wait_for_tarball.py
-------------------

This script queries Jenkins tarball-building jobs to find either a job
matching the provided --mpsha SHA building milestone-proposed.tar.gz,
or a job matching the provided --tag. It then waits for that job completion
and reports the built tarball name.

Examples:

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --mpsha=59089e56f674f5f94f67c5986e9a616bb669d846

  Looks for a cinder-branch-tarball job matching SHA 59089e... which would
  produce a milestone-proposed.tar.gz tarball, and waits for completion

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --tag=2013.1.1

  Looks for a cinder-tarball job for tag "2013.1.1" and waits for completion.


upload_release.py
-----------------

This script grabs a tarball from tarballs.openstack.org and uploads it
to Launchpad, marking the milestone released and inactive in the process.

The script prompts you to confirm that the tarball looks like the one you
intend to release, and to sign the tarball upload.

Examples:

./upload_release.py nova 2013.1 --milestone=grizzly-3

  Uploads Nova's nova-2013.1.g3.tar.gz to the grizzly-3
  milestone as nova-2013.1.g3.tar.gz

./upload_release.py glance 2013.1 --test

  Uploads Glance's glance-2013.1.tar.gz to the final "2013.1" milestone
  as glance-2013.1.tar.gz, on Launchpad staging server

./upload_release.py cinder 2012.2.3 --tarball=stable-folsom

  Uploads Cinder's current cinder-stable-folsom.tar.gz to the 2012.2.3
  milestone as cinder-2012.2.3.tar.gz


consolidate_release_page.py
---------------------------

This script moves blueprints and bugs from interim milestones to the final
release milestone page, in order to show all bugs and features fixed during
the cycle. For Swift, this will only move X-rc* bugs and blueprints to
final X release.

The --copytask mode is an experimental variant where a series bugtask is
created and the release milestone is set on that bugtask, preserving the
information from the "development" bugtask (and the milestone the bug was
fixed in).

Examples:

./consolidate_release_page.py cinder grizzly 2013.1

  Moves Cinder blueprints and bugs from intermediary grizzly milestones
  to the final 2013.1 milestone page.

./consolidate_release_page.py --test swift grizzly 1.8.0

  Moves Swift 1.8.0-rc* blueprints and bugs to the final 1.8.0 page, on
  Launchpad staging server

./consolidate_release_page.py --copytask glance grizzly 2013.1

  Moves Glance blueprints from intermediary grizzly milestones to the final
  2013.1 milestone page. Creates grizzly series task for all grizzly bugs
  and sets the milestone for those to 2013.1.


create_milestones.py
--------------------

This script lets you create milestones in Launchpad in bulk. It is given a
YAML description of the milestone dates and the projects to add milestones
to. The script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times. See
create_milestones.sample.yaml for an example configuration file.

Example:

./create_milestones.py havana.yaml


mpdelivery.sh
-------------

Script that does in one shot everything that is needed to deliver a
development milestone. It calls other scripts from openstack-releasing
to do its task.

Example:

./mpdelivery.sh 2013.2 havana-1 2013.2.b1 horizon
