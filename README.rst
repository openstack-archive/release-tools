==========================================================================
openstack-releasing - A set of scripts to handle OpenStack release process
==========================================================================

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need the following Python modules installed:
 - launchpadlib

similar_tarballs.sh also requires that you have tardiff installed.  If it's not
packaged for your distribution, you can find it at
http://tardiff.coolprojects.org/.


Top-level scripts
=================

The top-level scripts call the various base tools to get their work done.

milestone.sh
------------

This script handles all development milestone publication tasks. It creates
a tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball build, lets you doublecheck tarball
similarities, turns FixCommitted bugs into FixReleased ones (and targets them
to the milestone), and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while
marking it released).

It supports special cases for the release of a swift intermediary release
(where bugs should have been processed using swiftrc.sh beforehand), and
oslo-incubator (where no tarball is generated or needs to be uploaded).

Example:

./milestone.sh juno-3 HEAD keystone

  Apply 2014.2.b3 tag to HEAD of keystone master branch, check resulting
  tarball, mark FixCommitted bugs as released, upload tarball to Launchpad
  and mark Launchpad milestone released.


swiftrc.sh
----------

Swift's intermediary releases tag a RC1 candidate on master and let them bake,
so the all-in-one milestone.sh doesn't work there. swiftrc.sh creates a RC1
tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball build, lets you doublecheck tarball
similarities, and turns FixCommitted bugs into FixReleased ones (and targets
them to the milestone). When the RC1 is deemed ready, you can run milestone.sh
to tag and upload the final release.

Example:

./swiftrc.sh 7432f32d838ab346c 2.1.0

  Apply 2.1.0.rc1 tag to Swift's 7432f32d838ab346c commit, check resulting
  tarball, mark FixCommitted bugs as released and target them to the 2.1.0
  milestone.


rccut.sh
--------

Final release follows a slightly different process. Just before RC1 we need
to create a proposed/* release branch. rccut.sh creates a proposed/$SERIES
branch from the specified SHA, and turns all Launchpad bugs for the RC1
milestone to FixReleased (which means "present in the release branch").

It special-cases Swift, where an additional parameter is provided to specify
the version number of the final release. It also special-cases oslo-incubator,
where it doesn't wait for a tarball to be built.

Examples:

./rccut.sh 7432f32d838ab346c juno nova

  Create a proposed/juno branch for Nova at commit 7432f32d838ab346c, and
  mark FixCommitted bugs FixReleased, while targeting them to the juno-rc1
  milestone.

./rccut.sh HEAD juno swift 2.2.0

  Create a proposed/juno branch for Swift from master's HEAD commit, and
  mark FixCommitted bugs FixReleased, while targeting them to the 2.2.0-rc1
  milestone.


rcdelivery.sh
-------------

This script is used to publish RCs and final release from the proposed/$SERIES
branch. It applies the RC or final tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball
build, lets you doublecheck tarball similarities, and upload the resulting
tarball to Launchpad (while marking it released).

It special-cases Swift, where an additional parameter is provided to specify
the version number of the final release. It also special-cases oslo-incubator,
where no tarball is generated or needs to be uploaded.

Examples:

./rcdelivery.sh juno rc1 cinder

  Push 2014.2.rc1 tag to current cinder proposed/juno branch HEAD, wait for the
  tarball build, and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while marking
  it released).

./rcdelivery juno rc2 swift 2.3.0

  Push 2.3.0.rc2 tag to current swift proposed/juno branch HEAD, wait for the
  tarball build, and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while marking
  it released).

./rcdelivery juno final neutron

  Push 2014.2 final tag to current neutron proposed/juno branch HEAD (which
  should be the last RC), wait for the tarball build, and upload the resulting
  tarball to Launchpad (while marking it released).


Base tools
==========

ms2version.py
-------------

Converts milestone code names (juno-1) to version numbers suitable for tags
(2014.2.b1). If used with --onlycheck, only checks that the milestone
exists in Launchpad (useful for Swift where the rules are different).

Examples:

./ms2version.py nova juno-3

  Returns 2014.2.b3 (after checking that the juno-3 milestone exists in Nova)

./ms2version.py swift 2.1.0 --onlycheck

  Exists successfully if there is a 2.1.0 milestone in Swift.


repo_tarball_diff.sh
--------------------

This script fetches a specific branch from a git repository into a temp
directory and compares its content with the content of a tarball produced
from it (using "python setup.py sdist"). The difference should only contain
additional generated files (Changelog, AUTHORS...) and missing ignored
files (.gitignore...).

Example:

./repo_tarball_diff.sh nova master

  Check the difference between Nova master branch contant and a tarball
  that would be generated from it.


similar_tarballs.sh
-------------------

This script compares the content of two tarballs on tarballs.openstack.org.

Example:

./similar_tarballs.sh nova milestone-proposed 2013.1.rc1

  Check content differences between nova-milestone-proposed.tar.gz and
  nova-2013.1.rc1.tar.gz, as found on http://tarballs.openstack.org.


process_bugs.py
---------------

This script fetches bugs for a project (by default all "FixCommitted" bugs,
or all open bugs targeted to a given milestone if you pass the --milestone
argument) and sets a milestone target for them (--settarget) and/or sets their
status to "Fix Released" (--fixrelease).

It ignores bugs that have already a milestone set, if that milestone does
not match the one in --settarget.

Examples:

./process_bugs.py nova --settarget=grizzly-3 --fixrelease

  Sets the target for all Nova FixCommitted bugs to grizzly-3 
  and mark them 'Fix Released'.

./process_bugs.py glance --settarget=grizzly-2 --status='Fix Released' --test

  Test setting the target for all untargeted Glance FixReleased bugs to
  grizzly-2 on Launchpad Staging servers.

./process_bugs.py neutron --milestone juno-3 --settarget juno-rc1

  Move all juno-3 open bugs from juno-3 to juno-rc1 milestone.


wait_for_tarball.py
-------------------

This script queries Jenkins tarball-building jobs to find either a job
matching the provided --mpsha SHA building milestone-proposed.tar.gz,
or a job matching the provided --tag. It then waits for that job completion
and reports the built tarball name.

Examples:

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --mpsha=59089e56f674f5f94f67c5986e9a616bb669d846

  Looks for a cinder-branch-tarball job matching SHA 59089e... which would
  produce a milestone-proposed.tar.gz tarball, and waits for completion

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --tag=2013.1.1

  Looks for a cinder-tarball job for tag "2013.1.1" and waits for completion.


upload_release.py
-----------------

This script grabs a tarball from tarballs.openstack.org and uploads it
to Launchpad, marking the milestone released and inactive in the process.
If used with the --nop argument, it will only mark the milestone released and
inactive (this is used for projects like oslo-incubator which do not release
source code).

The script prompts you to confirm that the tarball looks like the one you
intend to release, and to sign the tarball upload.

Examples:

./upload_release.py nova 2013.1 --milestone=grizzly-3

  Uploads Nova's nova-2013.1.g3.tar.gz to the grizzly-3
  milestone as nova-2013.1.g3.tar.gz

./upload_release.py glance 2013.1 --test

  Uploads Glance's glance-2013.1.tar.gz to the final "2013.1" milestone
  as glance-2013.1.tar.gz, on Launchpad staging server

./upload_release.py cinder 2012.2.3 --tarball=stable-folsom

  Uploads Cinder's current cinder-stable-folsom.tar.gz to the 2012.2.3
  milestone as cinder-2012.2.3.tar.gz


consolidate_release_page.py
---------------------------

This script moves blueprints and bugs from interim milestones to the final
release milestone page, in order to show all bugs and features fixed during
the cycle. For Swift, this will only move X-rc* bugs and blueprints to
final X release.

The --copytask mode is an experimental variant where a series bugtask is
created and the release milestone is set on that bugtask, preserving the
information from the "development" bugtask (and the milestone the bug was
fixed in).

Examples:

./consolidate_release_page.py cinder grizzly 2013.1

  Moves Cinder blueprints and bugs from intermediary grizzly milestones
  to the final 2013.1 milestone page.

./consolidate_release_page.py --test swift grizzly 1.8.0

  Moves Swift 1.8.0-rc* blueprints and bugs to the final 1.8.0 page, on
  Launchpad staging server

./consolidate_release_page.py --copytask glance grizzly 2013.1

  Moves Glance blueprints from intermediary grizzly milestones to the final
  2013.1 milestone page. Creates grizzly series task for all grizzly bugs
  and sets the milestone for those to 2013.1.


create_milestones.py
--------------------

This script lets you create milestones in Launchpad in bulk. It is given a
YAML description of the milestone dates and the projects to add milestones
to. The script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times. See
create_milestones.sample.yaml for an example configuration file.

Example:

./create_milestones.py havana.yaml


spec2bp.py
----------

This experimental script facilitates setting blueprint fields for approved
specs. You point it to a spec file in a -specs repository, and it will set the
Approver, definition status, spec URL, priority and milestone as you specify.
By default priority is set to 'Low'.

In order for this to work, the spec must have the same name as the blueprint.

Examples:

./spec2bp.py ../oslo-specs/specs/juno/graduate-oslo-i18n.rst juno-3

  Set the graduate-oslo-i18n oslo blueprint in Launchpad to Approved, set
  yourself as approver, set the spec URL, priority to Low and milestone to
  juno-3.

./spec2bp.py warp-speed.rst kilo-1 --priority=High --test

  On Launchpad test servers, try setting the warp-speed blueprint fields as
  above (with priority set to High and milestone set to kilo-1).
