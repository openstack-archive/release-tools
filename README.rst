==========================================================================
openstack-releasing - A set of scripts to handle OpenStack release process
==========================================================================

Prerequisites
=============

You'll need the following Python modules installed:
 - launchpadlib

similar_tarballs.sh also requires that you have tardiff installed.  If it's not
packaged for your distribution, you can find it at
http://tardiff.coolprojects.org/.


Top-level scripts
=================

The top-level scripts call the various base tools to get their work done.

milestone.sh
------------

This script handles all development milestone publication tasks. It creates
a tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball build, lets you doublecheck tarball
similarities, turns FixCommitted bugs into FixReleased ones (and targets them
to the milestone), and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while
marking it released).

It supports special cases for the release of a swift intermediary release
(where bugs should have been processed using swiftrc.sh beforehand), and
oslo-incubator (where no tarball is generated or needs to be uploaded).

Example:

./milestone.sh kilo-3 HEAD keystone

  Apply 2015.1.0b3 tag to HEAD of keystone master branch, check resulting
  tarball, mark FixCommitted bugs as released, upload tarball to Launchpad
  and mark Launchpad milestone released.


swiftrc.sh
----------

Swift's intermediary releases tag a RC1 candidate on master and let them bake,
so the all-in-one milestone.sh doesn't work there. swiftrc.sh creates a RC1
tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball build, lets you doublecheck tarball
similarities, and turns FixCommitted bugs into FixReleased ones (and targets
them to the milestone). When the RC1 is deemed ready, you can run milestone.sh
to tag and upload the final release.

Example:

./swiftrc.sh 7432f32d838ab346c 2.1.0

  Apply 2.1.0rc1 tag to Swift's 7432f32d838ab346c commit, check resulting
  tarball, mark FixCommitted bugs as released and target them to the 2.1.0
  milestone.


rccut.sh
--------

Final release follows a slightly different process. Just before RC1 we need
to create a stable/* release branch. rccut.sh creates a stable/$SERIES
branch from the specified SHA, and turns all Launchpad bugs for the RC1
milestone to FixReleased (which means "present in the release branch").

It special-cases Swift, where an additional parameter is provided to specify
the version number of the final release. It also special-cases oslo-incubator,
where it doesn't wait for a tarball to be built.

Examples:

./rccut.sh 7432f32d838ab346c liberty nova

  Create a series/liberty branch for Nova at commit 7432f32d838ab346c, and
  mark FixCommitted bugs FixReleased, while targeting them to the juno-rc1
  milestone.

./rccut.sh HEAD liberty swift 2.5.0

  Create a stable/liberty branch for Swift from master's HEAD commit, and
  mark FixCommitted bugs FixReleased, while targeting them to the 2.5.0-rc1
  milestone.


rcdelivery.sh
-------------

This script is used to publish RCs and final release from the stable/$SERIES
branch. It applies the RC or final tag, pushes it, waits for the tarball
build, lets you doublecheck tarball similarities, and upload the resulting
tarball to Launchpad (while marking it released).

It special-cases Swift, where an additional parameter is provided to specify
the version number of the final release. It also special-cases oslo-incubator,
where no tarball is generated or needs to be uploaded.

Examples:

./rcdelivery.sh kilo rc1 cinder

  Push 2015.1.0rc1 tag to current cinder stable/kilo branch HEAD, wait for
  the tarball build, and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while
  marking it released).

./rcdelivery liberty rc2 swift 2.5.0

  Push 2.3.0rc2 tag to current swift stable/liberty branch HEAD, wait for the
  tarball build, and upload the resulting tarball to Launchpad (while marking
  it released).

./rcdelivery kilo final neutron

  Push 2015.1.0 final tag to current neutron stable/kilo branch HEAD (which
  should be the last RC), wait for the tarball build, and upload the resulting
  tarball to Launchpad (while marking it released).


release_library.sh
------------------

This script is used to publish alphas and final releases for Oslo libraries.
Such libraries use a floating "next-$SERIES" milestone (for example,
'next-kilo'). While under development, when an alpha release is tagged,
FixCommitted bugs are turned to FixReleased (but remain targeted to
next-$SERIES). At final release, next-$SERIES is renamed to the final version
and the milestone is marked released.

Examples:

./release_library.sh juno 1.3.0.0a3 HEAD oslo.rootwrap"

  Push a 1.3.0.0a3 tag to oslo.rootwrap current HEAD. Mark all FixCommitted
  bugs in oslo.rootwrap to FixReleased in next-juno.

./release_library.sh juno 1.3.0 HEAD oslo.rootwrap"

  Rename the next-juno milestone to '1.3.0'. Push a 1.3.0 tag to oslo.rootwrap
  current HEAD. Mark all FixCommitted bugs in oslo.rootwrap (if any) to
  FixReleased in 1.3.0, and mark 1.3.0 released.

release_notes.py
----------------

This produces a set of release notes intended to be sent as an
announcement email when a new library or package is produced. It is
more suitable for libraries than for the major projects, because it
includes a list of all of the changes and diff-stats output to show
which files changed.

The script parses the README.rst to find a line matching "``Bugs:``",
extracts the URL following the colon, and includes that information in
the output.

The bugs URL is converted to a launchpad project URL and combined with
the final version number to produce a *milestone* URL.

The script uses ``python setup.py`` to determine the project name and
the one-line description to include in the output text.

Examples:

./release_notes.py ~/repos/openstack/oslo.config 1.7.0 1.8.0

  Print the release notes between versions 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 for the
  project in the ``~/repos/openstack/oslo.config`` directory.

./release_notes.py --show-dates --changes-only ~/repos/openstack/oslo.config 1.8.0 HEAD

  Print the list of changes after 1.8.0 for the project in the
  ``~/repos/openstack/oslo.config`` directory, including the date of
  the change but leaving out the email message boilerplate. This mode
  is useful for examining the list of unreleased changes in a project
  to decide if a release is warranted and to pick a version number.

list_unreleased_changes.sh
--------------------------

Given a branch and one or more repositories, produce a list of the
changes in those repositories since their last tag on that
branch. This is useful for deciding if a project needs to prepare a
release, and for predicting what the next release version should be by
looking at the commit logs.

./list_unreleased_changes.sh master openstack/oslo.config

  Print the list of changes in ``openstack/oslo.config`` along the
  master branch.

./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo $(./list_repos_by_project.py --code-only Oslo)

  Print the list of changes in the ``stable/kilo`` branch of all Oslo
  libraries.

list_oslo_unreleased_changes.sh
-------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh for all of the Oslo library
repositories.

./list_oslo_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo

is equivalent to:

./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/kilo $(./list_repos_by_project.py --code-only Oslo)

make_library_stable_branch.sh
-----------------------------

Libraries do not use proposed branches, and go directly to creating
stable branches using a pre-tagged release version. This script makes
that easy to coordinate and ensures that the desired version also
exists in launchpad as a released milestone and by updating the
.gitreview file in the new branch for future submissions.

list_repos_by_project.py
------------------------

Read the project list from the governance repository and print a list
of the repositories owned by the named project.

./list_repos_by_project.py Oslo

update_git_review.sh
--------------------

Update the .gitreview file in a specific branch of a checked out
repositories.

./update_git_review.sh stable/kilo ~/repos/openstack/oslo.*

Base tools
==========

rename_milestone.py
-------------------

Renames a Launchpad milestone.

Example:

./rename_milestone.py oslo.rootwrap next-juno 1.3.0

  Rename oslo.rootwrap next-juno milestone to 1.3.0.


ms2version.py
-------------

Converts milestone code names (juno-1) to version numbers suitable for tags
(2014.2.b1). If used with --onlycheck, only checks that the milestone
exists in Launchpad (useful for Swift where the rules are different).

Examples:

./ms2version.py nova kilo-3

  Returns 2015.1.0b3 (after checking that the kilo-3 milestone exists in Nova)

./ms2version.py swift 2.1.0 --onlycheck

  Exists successfully if there is a 2.1.0 milestone in Swift.


repo_tarball_diff.sh
--------------------

This script fetches a specific branch from a git repository into a temp
directory and compares its content with the content of a tarball produced
from it (using "python setup.py sdist"). The difference should only contain
additional generated files (Changelog, AUTHORS...) and missing ignored
files (.gitignore...).

Example:

./repo_tarball_diff.sh nova master

  Check the difference between Nova master branch contant and a tarball
  that would be generated from it.


similar_tarballs.sh
-------------------

This script compares the content of two tarballs on tarballs.openstack.org.

Example:

./similar_tarballs.sh nova stable-kilo 2015.1.0rc1

  Check content differences between nova-stable-kilo.tar.gz and
  nova-2015.1.0rc1.tar.gz, as found on http://tarballs.openstack.org.


process_bugs.py
---------------

This script fetches bugs for a project (by default all "FixCommitted" bugs,
or all open bugs targeted to a given milestone if you pass the --milestone
argument) and sets a milestone target for them (--settarget) and/or sets their
status to "Fix Released" (--fixrelease).

It ignores bugs that have already a milestone set, if that milestone does
not match the one in --settarget.

Examples:

./process_bugs.py nova --settarget=grizzly-3 --fixrelease

  Sets the target for all Nova FixCommitted bugs to grizzly-3 
  and mark them 'Fix Released'.

./process_bugs.py glance --settarget=grizzly-2 --status='Fix Released' --test

  Test setting the target for all untargeted Glance FixReleased bugs to
  grizzly-2 on Launchpad Staging servers.

./process_bugs.py neutron --milestone juno-3 --settarget juno-rc1

  Move all juno-3 open bugs from juno-3 to juno-rc1 milestone.


wait_for_tarball.py
-------------------

This script queries Jenkins tarball-building jobs to find either a job
matching the provided --mpsha SHA building milestone-proposed.tar.gz,
or a job matching the provided --tag. It then waits for that job completion
and reports the built tarball name.

Examples:

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --mpsha=59089e56f674f5f94f67c5986e9a616bb669d846

  Looks for a cinder-branch-tarball job matching SHA 59089e... which would
  produce a milestone-proposed.tar.gz tarball, and waits for completion

./wait_for_tarball.py cinder --tag=2013.1.1

  Looks for a cinder-tarball job for tag "2013.1.1" and waits for completion.


upload_release.py
-----------------

This script grabs a tarball from tarballs.openstack.org and uploads it
to Launchpad, marking the milestone released and inactive in the process.
If used with the --nop argument, it will only mark the milestone released and
inactive (this is used for projects like oslo-incubator which do not release
source code).

The script prompts you to confirm that the tarball looks like the one you
intend to release, and to sign the tarball upload.

Examples:

./upload_release.py nova 2015.1.0 --milestone=kilo-3

  Uploads Nova's nova-2015.1.0b3.tar.gz to the kilo-3 milestone page.

./upload_release.py glance 2015.1.0 --test

  Uploads Glance's glance-2015.1.0.tar.gz to the final "2015.1.0" milestone
  as glance-2015.1.0.tar.gz, on Launchpad staging server

./upload_release.py cinder 2012.2.3 --tarball=stable-folsom

  Uploads Cinder's current cinder-stable-folsom.tar.gz to the 2012.2.3
  milestone as cinder-2012.2.3.tar.gz


consolidate_release_page.py
---------------------------

This script moves blueprints and bugs from interim milestones to the final
release milestone page, in order to show all bugs and features fixed during
the cycle. For Swift, this will only move X-rc* bugs and blueprints to
final X release.

The --copytask mode is an experimental variant where a series bugtask is
created and the release milestone is set on that bugtask, preserving the
information from the "development" bugtask (and the milestone the bug was
fixed in).

Examples:

./consolidate_release_page.py cinder kilo 2015.1.0

  Moves Cinder blueprints and bugs from intermediary kilo milestones
  to the final 2015.1 milestone page.

./consolidate_release_page.py --test swift grizzly 1.8.0

  Moves Swift 1.8.0-rc* blueprints and bugs to the final 1.8.0 page, on
  Launchpad staging server

./consolidate_release_page.py --copytask glance kilo 2015.1.0

  Moves Glance blueprints from intermediary kilo milestones to the final
  2015.1.0 milestone page. Creates kilo series task for all grizzly bugs
  and sets the milestone for those to 2015.1.0.


create_milestones.py
--------------------

This script lets you create milestones in Launchpad in bulk. It is given a
YAML description of the milestone dates and the projects to add milestones
to. The script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times. See
create_milestones.sample.yaml for an example configuration file.

Example:

./create_milestones.py havana.yaml


ensure_milestone.py
-------------------

This script lets you create one series and milestone in Launchpad. The
script is idempotent and can safely be run multiple times.

Example:

./ensure_milestone.py oslo.config liberty next-liberty


spec2bp.py
----------

This experimental script facilitates setting blueprint fields for approved
specs. It takes the project and blueprint name as arguments. For specs that
are still under review (--in-review) it will set them to "Blocked" (and
definition status to Review). For approved specs it will set definition
status to Approved, and set Spec URL. In both cases it will set the target
milestone, approver name and specified priority (by default, 'Low').

Examples:

./spec2bp.py glance super-spec --milestone=juno-2 --priority=Medium

  Glance's super-spec.rst was approved and you want to add it to juno-2,
  with Medium priority. This will do it all for you.

./spec2bp.py nova --specpath=specs/kilo/approved/my-awesome-spec.rst
  --in-review --milestone=juno-2

  Nova's my-awesome-spec.rst is still under review, but you would like to
  add the my-awesome-spec blueprint to juno-2 (marked Blocked). Since it's
  located in a non-standard path, we specify it using --specpath parameter.

./spec2bp.py nova my-awesome-spec --priority=High

  my-awesome-spec is now approved. You want to flip all the approval bits,
  but also change its priority to High. There is no need to pass --specpath
  again, spec2bp will infer it from the blueprint URL field.


stable_freeze.py
----------------

A script that can be used to quickly "freeze" all open reviews to a stable
branch.  It may also be used to "thaw" frozen reviews upon re-opening of
the branch for merges.  Reviews are frozen by adding a -2 and thawed by
reverting that and adding a 0.

Examples:

To view open reviews for stable/icehouse 2014.1.4:

./stable_freeze.py -r 2014.1.4 query

  View open reviews for stable/icehouse 2014.1.4.

./stable_freeze.py -r 2014.1.4 -o ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt

  Freeze all open reviews proposed to stable/icehouse. 2014.1.4-freeze.txt will
  contain all frozen reviews and this can be used to thaw later on.

./stable_freeze -r 2014.1.4 -i ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt thaw

  Thaw all reviews previously frozen and stored in 2014.1.4-freeze.txt.

./stable_freeze -r 2014.1.4 -i ~/openstack/2014.1.4-freeze.txt \
  -c 123777 -c 123778 freeze

  Freeze individual changes that have been proposed after the stable freeze
  period started.  References to these reviews will be appended to
  2014.1.4-freeze.txt to be unfrozen later on.


autokick.py
-----------

A script to periodically clean up blueprints (adjusting series goal based on
target milestone, and optionally kicking unpriotized blueprints from the
milestone. ttx is running it in a cron so you don't have to.

Examples:

To clean up Nova kilo blueprints:

./autokick.py nova kilo

highest_semver.py
-----------------

Reads a list of version tags from standard input and prints the
"highest" value as output, ignoring tags that don't look like valid
versions.


translation-cleanup.sh
----------------------

A script to cleanup translations for a release. It updates all
translation source files, downloads translation files and removes
translation files that are not sufficiently translated. It results in
a change that then needs to get reviewed and send to gerrits.

Examples:

To generate a cleanup patch for nova:

./translation-cleanup.sh kilo nova
